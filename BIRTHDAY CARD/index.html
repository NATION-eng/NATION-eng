      <p>
        You're a blessing to our family and everyone who knows you. Your
        unwavering faith, wisdom, and love inspire us every day. I thank God for
        giving me a father like you, who leads by example and serves with such a
        kind and generous heart. Wishing you a birthday filled with God's grace,
        abundant joy, and the fulfillment of all His promises for your life.
        Happy Birthday, Dad! ❤️
